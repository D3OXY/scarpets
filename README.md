# Scarpets
Scarpet scripts for small utilities.

Files with .sc format are mant to be used with `/script load <script_name> [global]`. Files with .mccmd format are a thing I came up with as a reminder that they are not apps per se. They are a very long command that needs to be pasted into an (impulse) command block and powered once. I did this because this way you can easly test stuff in a server and don't need access to server files to upload the .sc file.
