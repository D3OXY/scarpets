## Scarpets
Scarpet scripts for small utilities.

Files with .sc format are mant to be used with `/script load <script_name> [global]`. Files with .mccmd format are a thing I came up with as a reminder that they are not apps per se. They are a very long command that needs to be pasted into an (impulse) command block and powered once. I did this because this way you can easly test stuff in a server and don't need access to server files to upload the .sc file.

# Flowerify
Load with `/script load flowerify global`. It has two very simple functionalities: by running `/flowerify toggle_flowerify_continuous`, it will generate all flowers centered around the topmost gass block under the player in an 11x11 square. Move around to generate all of them. Optionaly, you can use `/flowerify set_pos 1` and `lowerify set_pos 2` to define a volume in which to generate flowers using the command `/flowerify flowerif_area`. You can hide/show the position markers with `lowerify set_pos [0|1]`. Go watch this dated [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T9oyzhIn1k) showcasing an old version of this.
